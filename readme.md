## Foam Setup

After setting up the repository, open [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) and edit, add or remove any settings you'd like for your Foam workspace.
To learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.

## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (markdown documents) to get you started.

-   [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorised later
-   [[foam-tips]] - tips to get the most out of your Foam workspace
-   [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[inbox]: inbox "Inbox"
[foam-tips]: foam-tips "Foam tips"
[todo]: todo "Todo"
